The average winning points are 77.01 points and the number are subtracted from each yearâ€™s winning points average. In that way, there can be a value of how much the average of each year exceeds or fall short of overall average. Two colors are mainly used to determine whether exceed or below average. The darker the color, the greater the number is from the origin. Blue color indicates above the average and red color indicates the other. Color opacity is used as well to reinforce the concept."

In this particular case, box plot is applied each season with unique values. For instance, 1989 season, one outstanding outlier is found outside of the box at about 150 points. Inside the box, two zones are separated by the median at 81.5 points, where most of the data values fall into."

However, sometimes that margin can be so small that it can be indistinguishable from one another. In this case, one little but critical aspect can be added to be more effective at emphasizing that minute difference. It is color saturation or opacity. Degree of the color can insist the magnitude of the data. In this particular case, the lower the average is, the lighter of the color it gets."
